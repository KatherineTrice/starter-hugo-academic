title: MIND-Child
summary: How does the need to make pragmatic inferences to map words impact novel word meaning memory? We have found that children can successfully acquire and retain meanings via pragmatic inference; moreover, effects of active pragmatic computation on meaning retention grow with development, resulting in better retention of pragmatically inferred over directly mapped words. Such a developmental difference in meaning consolidation is possibly mediated by childrenâ€™s developing theory of mind skills.
