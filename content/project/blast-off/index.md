title: BLAST-Off
summary: How do different modalities and domains of statistical learning skills grow and change across development, and what brain systems and connectivities underpin this? Here, we use online statistical learning in the MRI to tease apart the developmental timecourse of statistical learning in typically developing individuals, and critically examine hypotheses of invariance, change, and domain-general vs language-specifc mechanisms in statistical learning.
