summary: A technical session on autistic childrenâ€™s encoding and retrieval of pragmatically inferred words.
abstract: 'Typically developing children (4-9) and adults are able to mapped words via pragmatic inferences, and older children (6-9) and adults show a memory advantage for pragmatically inferred words. This advanage is linked to theory of mind abilities. Do autistic children, traditionally viewed as having weaker theory of mind skills, show the same? Find out in our talk!'
