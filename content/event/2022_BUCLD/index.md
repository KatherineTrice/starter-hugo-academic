summary: A talk on typically developing childrenâ€™s neural plasticity during statistical learning.
abstract: 'Statistical learning refers to the  implicit learning
process to extract regularities from sensory inputs, and shapes and is shaped in turn by language development. Furthermore, behaviorally, children learn statistical regularities much faster than adults. What are the developmental changes in the brain that underpin learning new patterns in the linguistic
domain? Find out in our talk!'
